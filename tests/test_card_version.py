"""Lock the byte-for-byte version sync between manifest, Python, and TS.

Without this assertion, a maintainer can silently bump one side and ship
a release whose CARD_VERSION mismatch triggers HA's reload-banner loop
(banner → reload → same JS → banner again, forever).

Expected value is derived from ``INTEGRATION_VERSION`` — i.e. from
``manifest.json`` — so a manifest-only bump that forgets the TS side
also trips this test. Python's ``CARD_VERSION`` is wired to
``INTEGRATION_VERSION`` in ``const.py``; the assertion below catches
both halves of the chain in one go.
